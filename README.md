# Simulation
Waiting Time Paradox = Memoryless property of Exponential Distribution  
In other words, there is no memory in process, history is not relevant  

The simulation creates environment where **<em>n</em>** buses are scheduled every **<em>x</em>** minutes, one passenger will go to the bustop for every **<em>y</em>** minutes. The experiment's purpose is to show that the average waiting time for each passenger is **<em>x</em>** minutes, where every passenger experience the similar waiting time regardless of what happened in the past.
